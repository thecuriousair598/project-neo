# Project Neo - Overview

## The Problem
Enterprises waste 30-40% of employee time navigating disconnected apps.



## Our Solution
A conversational AI layer on top of existing systems—no rip-and-replace.

Employees simply say:
- "Find best vendor to procure this product"
- "Show me my top customers"
- "Fill my timesheet for this week"
- or "File my expenses from the last trip"

and it does it instantly using user, department and enterprise context.

## Proof
**Odin** is live in production with real users.
