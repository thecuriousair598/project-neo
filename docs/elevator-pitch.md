# Elevator Pitch

Enterprises use dozens of disconnected apps for expenses, procurement, vendors and customers, creating complex integrations, heavy IT work and duplicated data.

We're building a conversational, intelligent, self-optimising AI layer that talks to all these apps with built-in analytics, privacy, security and zero lock-in.

Employees simply say:
- "Match this invoice,"
- "Book my timesheet,"
- or "File my expenses from the last trip,"

and it does it instantly using user, department and enterprise context.

We're now looking for partners to scale this.
